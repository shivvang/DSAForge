// Imagine a session as a box. If you don't put anything in the box during a request, 
// there's no reason to close it and store it again. This option makes sure we don't save the session if nothing in it changed.

// saveUninitialized: false: 

// If you create an empty box (a session) and don't put anything in it, this option prevents it from being saved. 
// It's like not saving an empty box because it's useless. We only save sessions that have data in them.

    //https://blog.logrocket.com/using-helmet-node-js-secure-application/

    //APIs developed in Express do not involve security HTTP headers. So, default Express apps come with some security concerns.

    //Without Helmet, default headers returned by Express expose sensitive information and make your Node.js app vulnerable 
    //to malicious actors. In contrast, using Helmet in Node.js protects your application from XSS attacks, 
    // Content Security Policy vulnerabilities, and other security issues.
